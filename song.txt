Going on a living spree
Plenty wanna come with me
You don't wanna miss your chance
Near-life experience

Faces making noise
Say, be good girls and boys
It ain't half empty or full
You can break the glass, or drink it all

Dig it
Close
Come close
Close
Come close

A glamour cabaret
The last float on parade
'Cause their swing got left behind
Every puzzle piece of mind
